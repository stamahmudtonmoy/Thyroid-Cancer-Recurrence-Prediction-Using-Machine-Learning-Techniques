# Thyroid-Cancer-Recurrence-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
I completed a machine learning project for my university course on CSE445, where I applied various machine learning approaches to predict the recurrence of thyroid cancer. In this project, I utilized six different machine learning models along with two ensemble techniques. Ultimately, the Random Forest model proved to be the best-performing option.
